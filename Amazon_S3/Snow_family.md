### Data Migrations with AWS Snow Family

Offline devices to perform data migrations- if it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices. 

This means if a client has a big amount of data they want to transfer into S3 bucket, then they will request a snowball device from AWS. AWS will send the client the device by post, then the client load the data locally and ship it back to AWS, then AWS will import/export data into the S3 bucket. 

Snowball Edge (for data transfers) - 8TB

AWS Snowcone and Snowcone SSD  - 80 TB

AWS Snowmobile (actual truck) to transfer data - <100 PB

#### What is Edge Computing?

Edge location is anywhere that doesnâ€™t have internet. For example truck on the road, ship on the sea, mining station underground.

These locations may have 

- Limited / no internet access
- Limited / no easy access to computing power
