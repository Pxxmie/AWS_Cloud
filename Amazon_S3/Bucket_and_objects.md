# Creating Buckets and Uploading Objects

1) Search S3 on top bar of services and create bucket 

    ![Untitled](images/Untitled.png)

2) Fill in unique name as well as the region you want to be selected. Leave the rest of the configuration the same.

3) Our bucket has been created- each bucket is assigned to a specific region, in this case eu-west-1.

4) Now click on the bucket, and lets start uploading objects. Click on upload. Iâ€™ve uploaded a cat.jpg for test.

5) Now after you have uploaded, go into your bucket again and click on the object for a overview. Click on open on the top right and your image should appear in a new webpage. (preassigned url)

    ![Untitled](images/Untitled%205.png)

    ![Untitled](images/Untitled%206.png)

6) However, if we wanted to access our url by copy and pasting the object url, we will get a access denied error. This means we cannot access our image using the public url, as our image is not public.

7) Now, within the bucket, we are going to create a folder called **images**.

    ![Untitled](images/Untitled%208.png)

    ![Untitled](images/Untitled%209.png)

8) In our new images folder, I have uploaded a new jpg file.

    ![Untitled](images/Untitled%2010.png)

9) You can also delete by just clicking on the folder or image and pressing delete on the task bar.
